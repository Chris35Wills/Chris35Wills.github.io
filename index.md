Following work as a glaciology researcher over the past few years, I am now working at the British Geological Survey. Iâ€™ve a keen interest in geospatial problem solving and environmental spatio-temporal relationships. Check out my [blog](../blog) for information on current geo-related solutions as well as tips and tricks relating to on-going code development.

**Past projects include:**

- the development of synthetic fjord bathymetry in the absemnse of data - read a paper on it [here](https://www.the-cryosphere.net/11/363/2017/tc-11-363-2017.html) and the most recent release of the code [here](https://zenodo.org/record/827347#.Waa1ociGPcs)
- automated assessment of crevasse patterns for assessing crevasse evolution - check out the most recent release of the code [here](https://zenodo.org/record/830251#.Waa1f8iGPcs)
- spatially distributed grid based mass balance modelling - [here's a model you can play with](https://github.com/Chris35Wills/SEB_model_java_files)
- hypersepctral image analysis over tidewater glaciers to identify presence of water 
- glacier reconstruction through the compilation of old (topographic maps) and new datasets (contemporary field surveys)
