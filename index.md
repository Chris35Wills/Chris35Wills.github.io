<!--Following work as a glaciology researcher over the past few years, I am now working at the British Geological Survey. Iâ€™ve a keen interest in geospatial problem solving and environmental spatio-temporal relationships.--> 
Welcome! I'm a geospatial scientist currently working at the British Geological Survey in geoanalytics. My background is in physical geography, glaciology research and geomorphology, having worked extensively both field and desk based. I spend a lot of my time developing workflows for geospatial analysis and the modelling of surface processes. I'm working predominantly in Python (with some R) with a focus on geo-product development - relating in particular to geohazards. If you want to know more, don;t hesitate to get in touch.

**Past projects include:**

- the development of synthetic fjord bathymetry in the absence of data - read a paper on it [here](https://www.the-cryosphere.net/11/363/2017/tc-11-363-2017.html) and the most recent release of the code [here](https://zenodo.org/record/827347#.Waa1ociGPcs)
- automated assessment of crevasse patterns for assessing crevasse evolution - check out the most recent release of the code [here](https://zenodo.org/record/830251#.Waa1f8iGPcs)
- spatially distributed grid based mass balance modelling - [here's a model you can play with](https://github.com/Chris35Wills/SEB_model_java_files)
- hyperspectral image analysis over tidewater glaciers to identify presence of water 
- glacier reconstruction through the compilation of old (topographic maps) and new datasets (contemporary field surveys)
