<!--Following work as a glaciology researcher over the past few years, I am now working at the British Geological Survey. Iâ€™ve a keen interest in geospatial problem solving and environmental spatio-temporal relationships.--> 
Welcome! I'm the Geospatial Analysis Lead working at the British Geological Survey. My background is in physical geography, glaciology research and geomorphology. I spend much of my time leading and working with teams to construct spatial solutions and products addressing a range of geo-environmental data problems. Technically, many of the workflows developed are built using Python and R, as well as including various GIS software platforms including ArcGIS and QGIS. 

I am particularly interested in spatio-temporal problem solving and the streamlining of data access and processing workflows.<!--; ultimately, to enable the development of more informed decisions for the purpose of environmental and social sustainable development.-->

If you want to know more, don't hesitate to get in touch.

<!--**Past projects include:**

- the development of synthetic fjord bathymetry in the absence of data - read a paper on it [here](https://www.the-cryosphere.net/11/363/2017/tc-11-363-2017.html) and the most recent release of the code [here](https://zenodo.org/record/827347#.Waa1ociGPcs)
- automated assessment of crevasse patterns for assessing crevasse evolution - check out the most recent release of the code [here](https://zenodo.org/record/830251#.Waa1f8iGPcs)
- spatially distributed grid based mass balance modelling - [here's a model you can play with](https://github.com/Chris35Wills/SEB_model_java_files)
- hyperspectral image analysis over tidewater glaciers to identify presence of water 
- glacier reconstruction through the compilation of old (topographic maps) and new datasets (contemporary field surveys)
