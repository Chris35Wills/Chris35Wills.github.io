<!--Following work as a glaciology researcher over the past few years, I am now working at the British Geological Survey. Iâ€™ve a keen interest in geospatial problem solving and environmental spatio-temporal relationships.--> 
Welcome! I'm the Geospatial Analysis Lead working at the British Geological Survey in geoanalytics. My background is in physical geography, glaciology research and geomorphology. I spend much of my time managing and working with teams to construct spatial solutions to environmental data problems, often directed towards end-user targeted spatial data products. Technically, many of these workflows tend to be Python and R focused, with a heavy focus on the use of GIS. 

Current projects include geohazard assessment and impacts of climate on future land surface processes with associated implications for land use planning and event response. 

I am particularly interested in spatio-temporal problem solving and the streamlining of data sharing and processing workflows; ultimately, to enable the development of more informed decisions for the purpose of environmental and social sustainable development.

If you want to know more, don't hesitate to get in touch.

<!--**Past projects include:**

- the development of synthetic fjord bathymetry in the absence of data - read a paper on it [here](https://www.the-cryosphere.net/11/363/2017/tc-11-363-2017.html) and the most recent release of the code [here](https://zenodo.org/record/827347#.Waa1ociGPcs)
- automated assessment of crevasse patterns for assessing crevasse evolution - check out the most recent release of the code [here](https://zenodo.org/record/830251#.Waa1f8iGPcs)
- spatially distributed grid based mass balance modelling - [here's a model you can play with](https://github.com/Chris35Wills/SEB_model_java_files)
- hyperspectral image analysis over tidewater glaciers to identify presence of water 
- glacier reconstruction through the compilation of old (topographic maps) and new datasets (contemporary field surveys)
