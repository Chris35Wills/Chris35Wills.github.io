## Current interests

- Anisotopic interpolation of bathymetric channel features with ''a priori'' process knowledge
- Mass conservation as a means of glacier bed mapping
- Lidar time correction approaches to allow seamless velocity map development for fast moving tidewater glaciers
- Automated crevasse mapping routines and application in Greenland and Iceland (contact me if you want more info)

## In preparation

- Williams, C., Carrivick, J.L., (in prep). Evaluating mountain glacier change and mass balance sensitivity in Northern Sweden 1926-2010 (target journal: Journal of Glaciology).

- Williams, C., Luckman, A., O’Leary, M., Murray, T., Benn, D., (in prep.) Crevasse evolution at Helheim glacier at high resolution: Implications for the calving process (target journal: Journal of Glaciology).

- Williams, C., Luckman, A., O’Leary, M., Murray, T., Benn, D., (in prep.) Two dimensional crevasse orientation and spacing mapping using a Fourier transform approach (target journal: Earth Surface Processes and Landforms).
