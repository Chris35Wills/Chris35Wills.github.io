If it has a spatial component, it has my attention - ice, flora, fauna...

## Current interests

- Open source geospatial solutions to various geoscience problems (take a look at the [blog](http://chris35wills.github.io/blog))

- Characterisiation of fjord systems in data sparse regions + associated method development (R/Python based)

- Automated crevasse mapping routines and application in Greenland and Iceland (Python based)

## Additional interests (things I'm keen to get more involved with)

- Open source GIS tools for crowd source disaster management and response ([here](http://www.wired.com/2015/05/the-open-source-maps-that-made-rescues-in-nepal-possible/) is a WIRED article on such tools as used following the Nepal earthquake)

- Data visualisation through web mapping applications (have a read [here](http://mediakar.org/a-brief-introduction-to-maps-how-geospatial-information-is-used-in-journalism-how-to-get-started/))
