<title> Research, code, pictures and maybe even some maps</title>

<p>Here are the dirty html beginnings to a webpage that will be updated far more frequently than all other previous attempts I have endeavoured upon as regard establishing some sort of web presence.</p>


<p>I'll be adding a lot more here and posting stuff blogstyle via Jekyll</p>

<p>Some topics I'll hopefully cover: Python/Java/GIS/Geostats/Glaciology(codewise)</p>
