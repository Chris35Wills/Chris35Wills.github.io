# What Next?

If this has whet your appetite for Python then I really recommend that you get hold of a Python book (like [Python Essential Reference](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Essential-Reference-Developers-Library/dp/0672329786/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1255794835&sr=8-5) and [Learning Python](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Python-Mark-Lutz/dp/0596513984/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1255794835&sr=8-3)). There are also hundreds of Python tutorials on the web (just perform a web search for [python tutorial](http://www.google.com/search?q='python%20tutorial') or [python for beginners](http://www.google.com/search?q='python%20for%20beginners')). The best way to learn Python though is to read other people's Python and copy it. Please feel free to copy, adapt and play with the examples in this workshop. They should hopefully provide the starting points for a range of simple tasks that you may wish to perform using Python.

Alternatively, if you want to continue you can take the [Intermediate Python](http://chryswoods.com/intermediate_python) course.
