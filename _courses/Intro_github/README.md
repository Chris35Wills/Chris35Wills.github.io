#Version Control using Git

Git is a version control system that allows you to save multiple versions
of a file or directory. This is useful to allow you to keep a record of 
all changes made to a file, and to move backwards and forwards in time
through different versions of your file. Think of it as the ultimate backup
system, similar to Apple's Time Machine, but available on any computer
and operating system. On top of this, Git can allow you to share the backup
with other people, allowing teams to work together, sharing and modifying
the files all at the same time. Think - no more emailing different versions
of files to each other. Git allows to work together on shared files 
in the cloud.

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) 
is an example of a [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) 
system. There are many different
version control systems, [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), 
[subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion), 
[mercurial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial) etc.

Git was originally developed to manage version control for the Linux kernel,
but has now expanded and is, perhaps, the most widely used revision control
system in science. As a former CVS and subversion user, I recommend Git as
the best revision control system to now use, simply because the support tools
available are the most advanced and most developed. Git has been strongly
embraced by the wider community, and you will have a wide selection of tools
that will help you use and build upon Git.

Git is free and open source, and there are 
[many](http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
[Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
[tutorials](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
[available](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Git/article.html).

This is a short course that will provide you with a quick taste of Git. 
Please work through this course at your own pace. Git is best learned by using it, 
so please copy out and play with the examples provided, and also have a go at the exercises.
