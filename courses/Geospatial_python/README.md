# Dealing with geospatial data with Python

Python is an extensive, diverse, freely available, easy to use language for dealing with various types of data, including geospatial. 

Both [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/features/) and [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) offer a python interface, with many of the tools in QGIS being written in Python as well (see the [PyQGIS developers package](http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/intro.html) if you want to build something!).

To provide an introduction to geospatial raster data I/O, analysis and plotting using [GDAL](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/), [PyProj](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj?), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org), take a look at the following exercises:

***

* [Reading in data](../raster/spatial_data_io)
* [Projections](../raster/projections)
* [Basic analysis](../raster/basic_analysis)
* [Plotting](../raster/basic_analysis)
* [Projections revisited](../raster/projections) {% comment %} discuss changing geotransform information {% endcomment %} 
* [Writing out your data](../raster/spatial_data_io)

***

For working with geospatial vector data, take a look here:

***

* [Reading in data](../vector/spatial_data_io)
* [Projections](../vector/projections)
* [Basic analysis](../vector/basic_analysis)
* [Plotting](../vector/basic_analysis)
* [Writing out your data](../vector/spatial_data_io)

Execllent lecture notes on using Geoprocessing data with Python are available [here](http://www.gis.usu.edu/~chrisg/python/2009/) and delve into much more detail which extends from this crash course.

There are also a number of useful presentations about using python with geospatial data available [here](http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/tutorial_detail.php?id=110) which are well worth a look at.
