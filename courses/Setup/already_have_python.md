# I already have python installed...

Some of you may already have python. 

You can check this by opening a bash terminal (as installed above), and typing:

		which python

That will return the python installation that your machine will run when you type ```python```.

Assuming you do have python, you can check its version using:
		
		python --version

If you don't want to install anaconda python because you are happy with what you have, then please just make sure to have the following 
packages installed:

- numpy
- matplotlib

[IPython](http://ipython.org) can also be very handy - this comes bundled with the [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and [canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) python distributions - additional info to sort this out can be found [here](http://ipython.org/install.html).
