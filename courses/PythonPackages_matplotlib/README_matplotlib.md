# Matplotlib: scratching the surface

## What is it?

[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is a plotting library written for python, enabling you to create figures with very little code.

## Why should I use it?

Plotting with [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is fast, relatively easy and results in figures which are of publication quality.

## Examples

You can create things such as bar charts:

scatter plots:

!["Scatter plots"]({{ site.baseurl }}../scatter_demo21.png)

or even geospatial plots:

!["3D plots"]({{ site.baseurl }}../surface3d_demo4.png)

Take a look at the [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) for more examples and inspiration.

## Quick start

The material below provides a very basic introduction, giving you an overview of some of things that are possible with [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). The course makes use of [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - if you are unfamiliar with numpy, take a look [here](../../PythonPackages_numpy/README_numpy).
