# Matplotlib: what is it?

The matplotlib library enables you a fast and accessible way of plotting publication quality figures, which can be output in a variety of formats. Matplotlib's [pyplot](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html) offers a MATLAB style interface for creating and customising your plots. A few images of what is possible include:

For more information, look at the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/index.html) home page and take a look at the [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html).

This library can be used with all sorts of python formats and is useful for visualising arrays of data such as created using [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - if you are unfamiliar with numpy, take a look [here](../../PythonPackages_numpy/README_numpy).
