# What next...

If you plan to be creating and plotting geospatial data, then have a look at matplotlib's [basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/)).

The [matplotlib gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) is the best place for inspiration and the official [matplotlib page](http://matplotlib.org/index.html) provides you with the full module [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) and various examples. 

Despite all of this information and regardless of how simple some plots are to create, you will inevitably run in to the occasional problem (!) and it is inevitable that some things just won't make sense. Fortunately, there are many python programmers out there and many people of run into exactly the same issues. Consequently, there are various forums where people have asked questions for which various answers have been provided - [stackexchange.com](http://stackexchange.com/) is one such resource and this might just become your new favourite website. If you can't find an answer to your question, then create an account and ask the community! My only advise would be to follow the rules of stackexchange (explained when you start putting your question together) and to make sure you have searched for an answer before hand by considering the different ways your question could be posed - this will ultimately help avoid a public telling off on the forums :)
