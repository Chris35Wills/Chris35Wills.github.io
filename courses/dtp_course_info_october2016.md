# DTP Programming Course: 10th - 12th October 2016

Over the next 3 days, we will be working our way from introducing you to the Python language, developing on each step to provide you with knowledge of how the language works and therefore how you can apply it to your research work flow. We will also be looking at a couple of packages for fast and efficient numerical analysis and plotting for data visualisation. All of the course materials are designed for you to be able to work through them independently and at your own pace - programming is very much learnt by doing rather than just listening or reading. Wherever you see *"type this"* in any of the instructions, it is best to do just that! Avoid using copy and paste as becoming a better programmer is as much about training your fingers as your mind.

Throughout each day, examples will be rpesented, combining the different elements of each module and introducing a couple of additional useful bits of information.

## Schedule

***IMPORTANT***: Don't rush through this - there will likely be a number of new concepts for you to get to grips with so take your time and let it sink in! 

### Day 1 (9am - 5pm)

Ensure you have your machine set up by following the instructions [here](../Setup/setup).

Work your way through [Beginners Python](../Beginners_python/README).

If you finish all of the beginners course, have a look at [Intermediate Python](../Intermediate_python/README).

### Day 2 (9.30am - 5pm)

Work your way through [Intermediate Python](../Intermediate_python/README).

You should now have a basic overview of how Python works - now we can move on to some packages.

Work your way through the [numpy package](../PythonPackages_numpy/README_numpy) crash course (builds on the intermediate python course).

Have a look through the [matplotlib](../PythonPackages_matplotlib/README_matplotlib) crash course for image plotting (builds on the numpy 
course).

### Day 3 (9.30am - 3pm)

This last day will be looking at version control using [Github](http://github.com/).

Work your way through the [Intro to Github course](../Intro_github/README).

## Other information

Each day there will be a number of helpers to answer any of your queries - don't be shy to ask! 

Refreshments and lunch will be provided each day.
