# What Next?

Now that you have begun using Git I hope that you can see
that it can be a really useful tool for researchers and programmers.

Consider using Git to version control your

* Papers
* Research proposals
* Course / website material
* Research outputs (graphs, datafiles)
* Scripts
* Lab notes
* Software projects

As with all things, you will learn more about and become more comfortable
with Git the more you use it. Taking a little pain now to add it to
your workflow will give you a lot of benefit later on. 
At the very least it
will save you from losing some work if your computer hard disk fails.
