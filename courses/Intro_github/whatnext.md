# What Next?

Now that you have begun using Git I hope that you can see
that it can be a really useful tool for researchers and programmers.

Consider using Git to version control your

* Papers
* Research proposals
* Course / website material
* Research outputs (graphs, datafiles)
* Scripts
* Lab notes
* Software projects

Remember the fact that everything public though - if it shouldn't be in the public domain, ensure you make use of a private account for which you can specifically control access.

If you have a *.ac.uk* email address, you can apply for an academic github account that will give you 5 free private repos which you can use precisely for this purpose. To set up an academic account on GitHub, first [associate an academic email address with your account](https://help.github.com/articles/verifying-your-email-address/) and then [request a GitHub Education discount](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new).

You can also make your code on github citable - have a look [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) for more information.

As with all things, you will learn more about and become more comfortable with Git the more you use it. Taking a little pain now to add it to your workflow will give you a lot of benefit later on. 

At the very least it will save you from losing some work if your computer hard disk fails.
