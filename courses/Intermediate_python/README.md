# Intermediate Python

Welcome to a short course that will teach you more about the Python language, and also some things
about the tools of good programming practice and software design. While this course teaches 
Python, the software design ideas and techniques are very similar for all programming languages.

Hopefully you are all familiar with the basics of Python. If not, you can look at
[Beginning Python](../../Beginners_python/README) course. This is a short course,
that will provide a taste of the more intermediate techniques. Please work through
this coures at your own pace. Python is best learned by using it, so please copy out and play with the
examples provided, and also have a go at the exercises.
