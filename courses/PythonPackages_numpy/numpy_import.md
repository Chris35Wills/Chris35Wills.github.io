If you are using a distribution of Python (e.g. [Anaconda]() or [Canopy]()]), then numpy comes readily available.

In a python terminal, simply type the following:

```python
import numpy
```

Assuming this works, you should receive no error messages. If the module is not available then you'll need to have a look [here](http://www.scipy.org/install.html).
