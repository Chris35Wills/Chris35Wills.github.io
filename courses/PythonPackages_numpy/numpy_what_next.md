# What next?

That was a very brief introduction to [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - have a look online at the vast amounts of documentation.

If you are going to be working a lot with tabulated datasets, it would be well worth your while looking at the [pandas module](http://pandas.pydata.org/) - a quick starter can be found [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html).

If images are going to be a core part of your work, then [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/) is worth looking at.
