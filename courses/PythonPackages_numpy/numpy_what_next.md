# What next?

That was a very brief introduction to [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), whilst also touching on some of the tools available in the [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) packages. There is a huge amount iof help online as well as some useful literature ([for example...](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)).

On this site, for a quick look at plotting with matplotlib, check out [Matplotlib: Scratching the surface](../../PythonPackages_matplotlib/README_matplotlib).

If you are going to be working a lot with tabulated datasets, it would be well worth your while looking at the [pandas module](http://pandas.pydata.org/) - a quick starter can be found [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html).

If images are going to be a core part of your work, then [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/) is worth looking at.
