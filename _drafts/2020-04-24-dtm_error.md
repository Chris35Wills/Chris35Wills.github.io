# DTM noise blog post

* Considering noise on a DTM
* Often only provided with one error value ("global error")
* This is often specific to flatter areas
* Small errors can have big issues when clacualting derivatives
* Really then, when calculating a derivative e.g. slope, you should consider a range of values that could be representated rather than a single slope value based on a single DTM
	- especially important where processes you might model or that users of your dataset might want are slope dependent e.g. slope thresholds for hazard maps etc.
