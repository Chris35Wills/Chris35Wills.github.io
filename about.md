## More Information

I'm a cryospheric researcher with a keen interest in geospatial problems and environmental spatio-temporal relationships. Working with a variety of data - mainly of a remote sensing/GIS nature - I've a keen interest in different analytical tools and approaches and their associated development. My workhorse language is predominantly python althrough I'm also dipping in and out of Java and C as well as R. 

This site is really a way of me getting my notes and findings out there rather than keeping what I work out hidden away inside my computer - someone else might find this stuff useful too.
