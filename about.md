### More Information

I'm a cryospheric researcher with a keen interest in geospatial problems and environmental spatio-temporal 
relationships. Working with a variety of data - mainly of a remote sensing/GIS nature - I've a keen interest
in different analytical tools and approaches and their associated development. My workhorse language is 
predominantly python althrough I'm also dipping in and out of Java and C as well as R. 

This site is really a way of me getting my notes and findings out there rather than keeping what I work out 
hidden away in my computer - someone mind find this stuff useful too! So many things are duplicated - 
especially in science and this all boils down to a lack of sharing!
