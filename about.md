Position: Postdoctoral researcher in Glaciology

Research interests: Remote sensing, GIS, Glaciers, Geospatial analysis, Geostatistics, Open source, Python development, R

## Overview

A glaciologist working on (or rather underneath) the Greenland ice sheet. My current position involves the redevelopment of the bedrock underlying and the profiles of the fjord systems that spread away from the Greenland ice sheet. The aim of this current project is to better constrain the topography - especially of the coastal regions - of Greenland which is important for quantifiction of the impact of ice/ocean interactions on fast and dynamic tidewater outlet glaciers. 

I've a keen interest in geospatial problem solving and environmental spatio-temporal relationships - most of my work and development is carried out using [Python](https://www.python.org/). Check out the [posts](http://chris35wills.github.io/) section for information on current geo-related solutions as well as tips and tricks relating to on-going code development.

## Past projects

Past projects include:

- glacier reconstruction through the compilation of old (topographic maps) and new datasets (contemporary field surveys)
- spatially distributed grid based mass balance modelling ([here's a model you can play with](https://github.com/Chris35Wills/SEB_model_java_files))
- automated assessment of crevasse patterns for assessing crevasse evolution
- hypersepctral image analysis over tidewater glaciers to identify presence of water 
- glacier surface velocity mapping using elevation data
