## Overview

A glaciologist working in Arctic regions on mountain glaciers as well as the outlet glaciers of the Greenland ice sheet. My current position involves the redevelopment of the bedrock underlying the greenland ice sheet extending out to include coastal bathymetry. The aim of this current project is to get a better understanding of the topography especially around coastal Greenland which is important for enabling further process understanding around fast and dynamic tidewater outlet glaciers. 

I've a keen interest in geospatial problem solving and environmental spatio-temporal relationships - most of my work and development is carried out using [Python](https://www.python.org/). Check out the [posts](http://chris35wills.github.io/) section for information on current geo-related solutions as well as tips and tricks relating to on-going code development.

## Past projects

Past projects include:

- glacier reconstruction through the compilation of old (topographic maps) and new datasets (contemporary field surveys)
- spatially distributed grid based mass balance modelling
- development of tools for mapping crevasse patterns and assessing crevasse evolution
- hypersepctral image analysis over tidewater glaciers to identify presence of water 
- glacier surface velocity mapping using elevation data
