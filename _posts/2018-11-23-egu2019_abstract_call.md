We draw your attention to the multidisciplinary session "Maximising information acquisition in a world of ever increasing data availability" (NP4.4/BG1.23/CR7.5/ESSI3.6/GM2.12/NH11.12/SSS11.8) to be held at the EGU General Assembly 2019 in Vienna (conveners: Chris Williams, Jeremy Ely, Maria J. Santos and Franziska Schrodt) - [**full abstract here**](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/session/30960)

We wish to bring together members from a range of disciplines to encourage cross-disciplinary interactions and to showcase the various methods currently being applied and developed to handle the extensive and varied datasets that are available to us today. We encourage submissions from research projects considering a range of data types, presenting processing work flows and/or innovative use or development of numerical techniques. 

We particularly invite contributions which showcase potential cross-disciplinary applications. Disciplines include but are not restricted to geomorphology, ecology, biogeochemistry, biology, meteorology, hydrology, glaciology and geology.

Please note the following EGU 2019 milestones:

**Abstract submission deadline is 10 January 2019, 13:00 (CET)**
**The travel support deadline requires submission by December 1st 2018**

We look forwards to receiving your abstract!
