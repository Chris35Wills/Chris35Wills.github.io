It has come to my attention that there is a free work book available taking the reader from basic python, to general statistical analysis, plotting and ultimately spatial data processing (think rasters and remote sensing). This is an incredibly useful resource and is available to [download here](http://freecomputerbooks.com/Python-Scripting-for-Spatial-Data-Processing.html?sthash.Antsenl3.mjjo) or [here](../../papers/python_scripting_for_spatial_data_processing.pdf).
