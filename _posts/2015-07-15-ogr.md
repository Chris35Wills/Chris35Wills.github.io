I'm often using the [gdal](http://www.gdal.org/gdal_utilities.html) library for reprojecting and resampling raster data but have rarely needed to do so with vector formats. When dealing with points, I usually sort out the conversion manually. For other vectors - polygons and polylines - often stored as [shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile), the ogr library of tools can be quite useful. [This page](http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/software/gdal-and-ogr-geodata-conversion-and-re-projection-tools/) provides a handy overview with some example data available for download. [Here](http://www.gdal.org/osr_tutorial.html) is a more verbose description of dealing with projections of vectors.
