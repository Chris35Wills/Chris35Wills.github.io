title: QGIS - handy plugins
categories: GIS

I was asked to demonstrate some plugins I find useful in QGIS. Some are pretty basic but are very handy! Here's a list and associated summary:

* **Value tool**: reports values of rasters beneath cursor
* **Zoom to Point**: zooms to a specified [x,y] location
* **Profile tool**: plots profile lines from single or multiple raster layers or point vector layers with an elevation field
* **QChainage**: takes line features and creates a new layer of points in provided distances on top of this Lines
* **Point sampling tool**: collects polygon attributes and raster values from multiple layers at specified sampling points
* **MMQGIS**: set of Python plugins for manipulating vector map layers: CSV input/output/join, geocoding, geometry conversion, buffering, hub analysis, simplification, column modification, and simple animation
